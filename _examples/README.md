# Finitewave examples

This directory contains a collection of examples that demonstrate the usage and capabilities of the Finitewave package. These examples are organized into different sections to help you get started with basic simulations and explore more advanced tools, such as trackers.

## Recommendations

To run an example, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the script. For instance, to run the Aliev-Panfilov 2D Anisotropic simulation:

```sh
cd basic
python aliev_panfilov_2D_aniso.py
```

## Examples structure

*/basic*

This section introduces the fundamental usage of the Finitewave package, providing minimal examples that demonstrate how to set up and execute simple cardiac simulations.

*/trackers/*

This section showcases the usage of various tracking tools provided by Finitewave. Trackers are used to perform measurements and gather data during simulations, which is crucial for analyzing the behavior of the cardiac models.
