    This class provides a base implementation for trackers that monitor and
    record various aspects of the simulation. Trackers can be used to gather
    data such as activation times, wave dynamics, or ECG readings.

    Attributes
    ----------
    start_time : float
        The time at which tracking will begin. Default is 0.
    end_time : float
        The time at which tracking will end. Default is infinity.
    step : int
        The frequency at which tracking will occur. Default is 1.
    tracking_counter : int
        A counter to keep track of the number of tracking events that have occurred.
    tracking_times : list
        A list to store the times at which tracking events occurred.
    model : CardiacModel
        The simulation model to which the tracker is attached. This allows
        the tracker to access the model's state and data during the simulation.
