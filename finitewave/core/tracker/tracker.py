class Tracker(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Base class for trackers used in simulations.

    This class provides a base implementation for trackers that monitor and
    record various aspects of the simulation. Trackers can be used to gather
    data such as activation times, wave dynamics, or ECG readings.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : CardiacModel
        The simulation model to which the tracker is attached. This allows
        the tracker to access the model's state and data during the simulation.

    file_name : str
        The name of the file where the tracked data will be saved.
        Default is an empty string.

    path : str
        The directory path where the tracked data will be saved.
        Default is the current directory.

    start_time : float
        The time step at which tracking will begin. Default is 0.

    end_time : float
        The time step at which tracking will end. Default is infinity.

    step : int
        The frequency at which tracking will occur. Default is 1.
