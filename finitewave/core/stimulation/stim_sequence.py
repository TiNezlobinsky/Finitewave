class StimSequence:
    """A sequence of stimuli to be applied to the cardiac model.

    This class manages a list of stimulation objects and applies them to the model based on the
    simulation time. It handles the initialization of stimuli, adding and removing stimuli,
    and applying the next set of stimuli in the sequence.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sequence : list
        A list of `Stim` objects representing the sequence of stimuli to be applied to the model.

    model : CardiacModel, optional
        The cardiac model to which the stimuli will be applied. This is set during initialization.

    Methods
    -------
    initialize(model)
        Prepares each stimulus in the sequence for application based on the provided model.

    add_stim(stim)
        Adds a `Stim` object to the sequence of stimuli.

    remove_stim()
        Clears the sequence of stimuli, removing all stimuli from the list.

    stimulate_next()
        Applies the next set of stimuli based on the current time in the model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : CardiacModel
            The simulation model that will be used to prepare the stimuli.
