    This class represents a type of stimulation where a current is applied to
    the model for a specified duration. It extends the base ``Stim`` class and
    includes methods for preparing the stimulation and updating its status
    based on elapsed time.

    ----------
    curr_value : float
        The current value to be applied during the stimulation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : float
            The time at which the current stimulation is to start.
        curr_value : float
            The current value to be applied during the stimulation.
        duration : float
