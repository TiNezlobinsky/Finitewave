    simulations.

    This abstract base class defines the interface for calculating stencil
    weights for numerical simulations. It includes a caching mechanism to
    optimize performance by reducing the number of symbolic calculations. Also,
    it handles the boundary conditions for the numerical scheme.

        Computes the stencil weights based on the provided parameters.

        This method must be implemented by subclasses to compute the stencil
        weights used for numerical simulations. The weights are calculated
        based on the tissue mesh and spatial step. Additional parameters can
        be passed as arguments or keyword arguments.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : CardiacModel
            A model object containing the simulation parameters.
        cardiac_tissue : CardiacTissue
            A tissue object representing the cardiac tissue.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
            A numpy array containing the stencil weights.
