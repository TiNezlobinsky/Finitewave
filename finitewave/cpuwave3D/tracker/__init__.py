"""
3D Tracker
==========

This module contains classes for tracking the evolution of the wavefront in 3D.
Most of the classes in this module are similar to the ones in the 2D tracker
module. More information can be found in the documentation for the 2D tracker
module.

The tracker classes can be grouped into the following categories:

* Full field trackers that track the entire field and output the results in
  a single array.
* Point trackers that track the evolution of a specific point(s) in the field.
* Animation trackers that track the evolution of the field over time and save
  the results as frames for creating animations.

Each tracker class has basic attributes such as ``start_time``, ``end_time``,
``step``, ``path``, and ``file_name``.

.. note::

    Note that the ``start_time`` and ``end_time`` is given in time units,
    and the ``step`` is the number of time steps between recordings.
