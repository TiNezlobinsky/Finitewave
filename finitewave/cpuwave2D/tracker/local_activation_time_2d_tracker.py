class LocalActivationTime2DTracker(Tracker):
    """
    A class to compute and track multiple activation times in a 2D cardiac
    tissue model simulation.

    This tracker monitors the potential across the cardiac tissue and records
    the times when cells surpass a specific threshold, supporting multiple
    activations such as re-entrant waves or multiple excitations.

    The activation times are stored in a array where each element is an array
    storing the activation times for each cell. Arrays can be not fully filled
    if faster cells activate before slower ones. In oreder to get the full
    activation times, the user should select the next closest activation time
    to the desired time base.

    Attributes
    ----------
    act_t : list of np.ndarray
        A list where each element is an array storing activation times for
        each cell. Preferably accessed through the output property.
    threshold : float
        The potential threshold to determine cell activation.
    file_name : str
        The file name for saving the activation times.

    Methods
    -------
    initialize(model):
        Initializes the tracker with the simulation model and precomputes
        necessary values.
    track():
        Tracks and stores activation times for each cell in the model at each
        time step.
    output:
        Returns the activation times.
    write():
        Saves the activation times to disk as a NumPy file.
