class ActivationTime2DTracker(Tracker):
    """
    A class to track and record the activation time of each cell in a 2D
    cardiac tissue model.

    This tracker monitors the membrane potential of each cell and records
    the time at which the potential crosses a certain threshold, indicating
    cell activation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    act_t : np.ndarray
        Array to store the activation time of each cell in the 2D model grid.
    threshold : float
        The membrane potential threshold value that determines cell activation.
    file_name : str
        Name of the file where the tracked activation time data will be saved.

    Methods
    -------
    initialize(model):
        Initializes the tracker with the simulation model, setting up
        the activation time array.
    track():
        Records the activation time of each cell based on the threshold
        crossing.
    output():
        Returns the tracked activation time data.
    write():
        Saves the tracked activation time data to a file.
